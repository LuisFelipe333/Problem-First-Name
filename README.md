# Problem-First-Name
Using first_names.txt (text file containing over five-thousand first names), begin by sorting
it into alphabetical order. Then workout the alphabetical value for each name, multiply
this value by its alphabetical position to obtain a name score.


Example: assuming sorted and COLIN to be the 938th name it is worth: 3+15+12+9+14. So,
the score would be 938*53 = 49,714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
